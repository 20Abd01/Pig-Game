Pig Game
The Pig Game is a simple two-player game where each player rolls a dice and accumulates points. The goal is to reach 100 points before your opponent. If a player rolls a 1, their current round's score is lost, and it's the next player's turn. Players can also choose to hold their current score, which adds it to their total score, but ends their turn.

Features
